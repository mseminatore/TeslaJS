An unofficial NodeJS library that encapsulates the Tesla RESTful API.  This 
library currently supports all existing Tesla vehicles.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/teslajs.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/teslajs/)
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/teslajs.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/teslajs/)

First, it is important to acknowledge that there are already several very 
good Javascript libraries available for the Tesla.  So why create another 
one?  Rather than contribute to or modify one or more of the existing 
libraries, this library was created for two main reasons:

1. The anticipated need for a few small but important features that existing 
libraries did not provide
2. I was looking for a personal opportunity to learn more about the Tesla REST 
API, NodeJS, Express and Git/GitHub

## Notable Features

With the introduction of the new OAuth-based owner API, one of the features I 
wanted was the ability to make API calls without having to login each time a 
new process was invoked.  Many existing libraries require a login transaction 
with each initiation of the library.  With the TeslaJS library, once an auth 
token is retrieved it can be cached and used to make other Tesla REST API 
calls.  For certain use cases, notably server logging of multiple vehicles, 
this can be important for moderating load on the Tesla login servers.  

This is also important if you want to use the library to do server-based data 
logging.  It is generally safer to store an OAuth token on the server rather 
than logon credentials.  If the server is compromised only the OAuth token is 
at risk and all existing tokens can be invalidated by changing the password on 
the account.

Another feature that I wanted was API stateless-ness (achieved via an **options** 
parameter to API calls) so that it was possible to use the library to make 
multiple overlapping async calls for different vehicles for data-logging.

## What's New!

You can read the complete history of changes in the 
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mseminatore/TeslaJS/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Here are some of the more recent features and fixes:

1. In **2.1.46** fix incorrect media endpoints
2. In **2.1.45** added media playback sample and methods
3. In **2.1.44** added minified version
4. In **2.1.43** added support and samples for software update and navigation request endpoints
5. In **2.1.42** merged PR's to improve streaming and fix JSON request bodies

## Known Issues

1. The homelink API appears to require Autopilot hardware.  Can someone with 
AP test and report back?
2. Calendar support not yet functional.  If someone can share the JSON for a 
valid calendar request that would help!

## Library Users

A growing number of projects use the library or are based on its code.  One such project is
the [Tesla Control](https://www.teslacontrol.app) app in the Windows Store.  This 
Universal Windows App runs on Windows desktop, Windows Phone and Xbox.

## Project Principles

This project has a few principles that have and will continue to guide its 
development.

1. **Dependency lean**.  Try to keep the required dependencies to a minimum.
2. **Comprehensive**.  Attempt to expose the full Tesla REST API surface area.
3. **Simple**.  Using the library should be simple and straightforward 
following common conventions.
4. **Server friendly**.  Provide for use based on auth tokens and avoid 
requiring access to passwords.

## Documentation

We've recently added auto-generated documentation via jsdocs.  See the
 [DOCS](https://github.com/mseminatore/TeslaJS/blob/master/docs/DOCS.md)
for a mostly complete reference.  Please let us know if you see something 
missing and we will continue to expand.

# Tesla API Documentation

The Tesla REST API encapusulated by this library was documented through the 
collaboration of many Tesla owners.  Please thank and support them for their 
efforts!  The current REST API documentation can be found at:

    http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/

> Note that timdorr has announced plans to migrate the documentation to a new 
> location.  This reference will be updated in the future once that migration 
> is complete.
	
# Warranty Disclaimer

You may use this library with the understanding that doing so is 
**AT YOUR OWN RISK**.  No warranty, express or implied, is made with regards 
to the fitness or safety of this code for any purpose.  If you use this 
library to query or change settings of your vehicle you understand that it 
is possible to make changes that could inadvertently lower the security of 
your vehicle, or cause damage, through actions including but not limited to:

* Unlocking the vehicle
* Remotely starting the vehicle
* Opening the sunroof
* Opening the frunk or trunk
* Lowering the battery charge level
* Impacting the long-term health of your battery

> Please be careful not to use this code in a way that loads the Tesla servers
> with too many concurrent requests. Calling the Tesla REST APIs at a very high 
> frequency will stress the Tesla servers and could get your IP or favorite
> cloud service blocked by Tesla.  Or in the worst case it could cause Tesla 
> to revoke the key that enables access via this and many other libraries.

# Installation

In order to use the library and/or samples you must first download and install
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org). An installable TeslaJS module for [npm](http://npmjs.org) 
is now available.

To download and install the library and all of its dependencies to a local 
project directory use the following:

    npm install teslajs

If you are building an npm package that depends upon this library then you 
will want to use the **--save** parameter in order to update the 
**package.json** file for your project. For example:

    npm install teslajs --save
    
If you prefer to download and install the library globally for all future 
node projects you may use:

    npm install -g teslajs

You may also install directly from the GitHub 
[source](https://github.com/mseminatore/TeslaJS).  Either download and unzip 
the source, or clone the repository.

> Remember, whether you install via ZIP source or Git clone you must install 
> the dependencies before using TeslaJS.

To install dependencies via npm, from the root level of the library directory 
type:

    npm install

This library and its accomanying samples are under active development.  New 
features, samples and bug fixes are being added regularly.  To ensure that 
you have the very latest version of TeslaJS and it's dependencies be sure to 
update frequently.

To do so, from your project directory type:

    npm update

# Usage Examples

## Login Example

As you can see below, it is very simple to login and acquire an OAuth token.

```javascript
    var tjs = require('TeslaJS');

    var username = "<your MyTesla email>";
    var password = "<your MyTesla password>";

    tjs.login(username, password, function(err, result) {
        if (result.error) {
          console.log(JSON.stringify(result.error));
          process.exit(1);
        }

        var token = JSON.stringify(result.authToken);

        if (token)
            console.log("Login Succesful!");
    });
```

> Note: Currently the only way to invalidate an issued token is to change your 
> MyTesla account password.  Therefore, you must take care to properly secure 
> tokens.  Do not share them over an unsecure connection, or store them on a 
> public machine.

## Vehicles Example

With the OAuth token from a successful `login()` API call you can query the 
vehicles for the account:

```javascript
    var options = { authToken: result.authToken };
    tjs.vehicles(options, function (err, vehicle) {
        console.log("Vehicle " + vehicle.vin + " is: " + vehicle.state);
    });
```

Or using the Async Promise-based calls:

```javascript
	tjs.vehiclesAsync(options).done(function(vehicle) {
        console.log("Vehicle " + vehicle.vin + " is: " + vehicle.state);
	});
```

## Charge State Example

Adding the vehicle ID from a successful `vehicles()` API call to options you can 
make other Tesla REST calls:

```javascript
    var options = { authToken: result.authToken, vehicleID: vehicle.id_s };
    tjs.chargeState(options, function (err, chargeState) {
        console.log("Current charge level: " + chargeState.battery_level + '%');
    });
```

And using the Async Promise-based calls:

```javascript
	tjs.chargeStateAsync(options).done(function(chargeState) {
        console.log("Current charge level: " + chargeState.battery_level + '%');
	});
```

Or using the `vehicleData()` API call:

```javascript
    tjs.vehicleData(options).done(function(vehicleData) {
        var chargeState = vehicleData.charge_state;
        console.log("Current charge level: " + chargeState.battery_level + '%');
    });

```

# Library Interfaces

The TeslaJS library exports a number of methods and constants.  The library 
also responds to some environment variables.

## Environment Variables

ENV variable | Description
------------ | -----------
TESLAJS_LOG | if set defines the value of the default logging level ([See constants](#library-exported-constants))
TESLAJS_SERVER | if set defines the URI for the Tesla servers (e.g. set to http://127.0.0.1:3000)
TESLAJS_STREAMING | if set defines the URI for the Tesla streaming servers (e.g. set to http://127.0.0.1:3000)

## General API Calls

These methods all require an `options` parameter with at least `options.authToken` defined.

Function | Description
-------- | -----------
getLogLevel() | gets the level of debug logging
setLogLevel() | sets the level of debug logging
getVin() | return the VIN from the vehicle object
getShortVin() | return short form VIN from the vehicle object
getPortalBaseURI() | gets the server URI
setPortalBaseURI() | sets the server for testing, pass null to reset
login() | authenticate with Tesla servers and retrieve the OAuth token
logout() | delete the current OAuth token
vehicles() | return information on the requested vehicle
vehicle() | same as above
allVehicles() | return information and option data for all vehicles
getModel(vehicle) | returns the Tesla model as a string from vehicle object
getPaintColor(vehicle) | returns the paint color as a string from vehicle object

> Note: In a future version `vehicles()` will return information on all vehicles,
> the `allVehicles()` call will be removed and `vehicle()` will return information
> on a specific vehicle.

## Vehicle-specific API calls

These methods all require an `options` parameter with at least `options.authToken` and `options.vehicleID` defined.

> Note: Vehicle objects from the API contain *three* different strings that look like potential candidates for `vehicleID`. The correct one is `id_s`, and **not** `id` or `vehicle_id`. Using the wrong ID will result in 404 errors.

> Note: The promise-based versions of the APIs have the suffix **Async** appended.  
> For example `vehicle()` and `vehicleAsync()`.

## Library Exported Constants

Constant | Description
-------- | -----------

API_LOG_ALWAYS | log this message always
API_CALL_LEVEL | log all API calls
API_RETURN_LEVEL | log all API calls and completions
API_REQUEST_LEVEL | log all API requests
API_RESPONSE_LEVEL | log all API responses
API_BODY_LEVEL | log calls and completions as well as the body of POST commands
API_LOG_ALL | the highest level of logging
CHARGE_STORAGE | charge to 50%
CHARGE_STANDARD | charge to 90%
CHARGE_RANGE | charge to 100%.  Tesla recommends against frequent usage!
MAX_TEMP | maximum temperature for climate system
MIN_TEMP | minimum temperature for climate system
SUNROOF_CLOSED | closes the sunroof
SUNROOF_VENT | open the sunroof to the vent position
streamingColumns | an array of the available streaming columns
FRUNK | constant for openTrunk API
TRUNK | constant for openTrunk API

Most of the APIs take both an **options** parameter and an optional 
**callback** function.  The **options** parameter must always contain a 
property called **authToken** that contains the OAuth token returned 
from a successfull `login()`.  For all APIs that act on a specific 
vehicle the **options** parameter must also contain a **vehicleID** 
member that contains the long vehicle ID value returned from a successful 
call to `vehicles()`.

By default the `vehicles()` API returns information on the first vehicle 
returned.  By providing a **carIndex** member in the **options** parameter 
information on a specific vehicle can be queried.
	
# Samples

A collection of samples are provided in the Examples directory.  These demonstrate 
some basic usage scenarios for the library.  To use the samples first:

    cd Examples
    node sampleName

After running the [login](#loginjs) sample an auth token will be cached locally.

If you prefer to avoid keeping an auth token on your machine, provide login 
credentials on the command line for each sample.  This will perform a login 
request and keep the token only for the duration of the sample.  The 
difference lies in whether you are more comfortable with the security of a 
file associated with an account in your file system vs. the visibility of 
your login credentials in the process table for the lifetime of the sample.

## login.js

This sample demonstrates the basic login process which returns the OAuth token required for other API calls.  The sample
writes out a file called **.token** which stores the OAuth token.  Other samples will use this cached token if present 
to avoid the need to enter the **username** and **password** and login via the Tesla servers.

>If you prefer not to have your OAuth token stored locally do not run this sample.  Instead you may run the samples and provide 
>the **username** and **password** each time on the command line.
